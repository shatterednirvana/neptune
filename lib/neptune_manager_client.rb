  # A helper method to make SOAP calls for us. This method is mainly here to
  # reduce code duplication: all SOAP calls expect a certain timeout and can
  # tolerate certain exceptions, so we consolidate this code into this method.
  # Here, the caller specifies the timeout for the SOAP call (or NO_TIMEOUT
  # if an infinite timeout is required) as well as whether the call should
  # be retried in the face of exceptions. Exceptions can occur if the machine
  # is not yet running or is too busy to handle the request, so these exceptions
  # are automatically retried regardless of the retry value. Typically
  # callers set this to false to catch 'Connection Refused' exceptions or
  # the like. Finally, the caller must provide a block of
  # code that indicates the SOAP call to make: this is really all that differs
  # between the calling methods. The result of the block is returned to the
  # caller.
